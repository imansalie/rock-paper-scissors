# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## Overview

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a classic hand game that is often used as a simple decision-making tool. In this game, each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand:

- Rock (a fist)
- Paper (an open hand)
- Scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V)

The game has three possible outcomes other than a tie:

- Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins)
- Scissors cuts Paper (Scissors wins)
- Paper covers Rock (Paper wins)
